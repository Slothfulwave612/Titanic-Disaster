# Titanic-Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, we will try to analyze the data of the passengers in the Titanic and try to find out what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we will apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) has been done on the dataset to know about the Titanic Disaster and applied Machine Learning Algorithms to predict which passenger survived and which paseenger died in the disaster.

K-Fold cross validation is used in our training process and using Grid Search we have find the optimal algorithm for our dataset.

Random Forest is the best performing algorithm with an accuracy of 84.62%
